### Goal

This is my simple application use to learn GraphQL and Apollo while using the MERN stack. This application on the front can add books with title, small description, genre of type and add the author corresponding to the book. However, in the GraphQL console it has a full crud functionality for both authors and books.

### Installion

Requirements:
1. Install of NodeJs
2. Have a local mongoDB running

To install the application please run the following commands:
1. Npm run build-client
2. Npm run build-server
3. Npm run start

The application will execute on port 3000 for the frontend and GraphQL console on port 4000

### Credits

I would like to thanks Shaun from "freeCodeCamp.org" for the tutorial.
